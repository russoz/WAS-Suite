Update POD

Make a script that goes into /bin, something like: was-app-install
- use MooseX::Getopt

Do a dry-run by default

Code the local install

Work with configuration files
- constructor will need a section from the config file to work with
  - one config file, multiple instances
  - or maybe this should be done by the calling script

Study the Net::SSH::Perl and check if it's possible to work with file handles
rather than scalars for stderr and stdout.

Improve timestamping on the output

Colorized output
- stdout => green
- stderr => red

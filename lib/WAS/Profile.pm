=head1 NAME

WAS::Profile - A simple representation of a WAS application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use WAS::Profile;
	
	my $profile = WAS::Profile->new(
		name => 'AppSrv01',
		path => '/usr/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01',
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple Moose-based class that represents a WAS profile. 

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

Name of the WAS profile. Although no validation is performed to check whether
there is a profile with that name, it is B<strongly> recommended that only
a real profile name be used in here. There might be some actual validation
in the future, and using an invalid profile name might break your application.

=head2 path

Path for the WAS profile root directory. There is no validation either, but
path is actually used to run C<wsadmin> scripts later on, so it must be valid.

=head2 host

Optional parameter specifying the hostname for this WAS profile. If empty,
C<< WAS::Profile >> will assume WAS is installed locally. If set, it will try
to determine whether the host name specified corresponds to the local host.

=cut

has name => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', required  => 1, );
has path => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', required  => 1, );
has host => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', predicate => 'has_host' );

=head2 wsadmin

The name of the C<wsadmin> script. Defaults to C<wsadmin.sh>.

=head2 wsadmin_args[]

Optional list of arguments to be used by C<wsadmin>. Empty by default.

=cut

has wsadmin => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', default => 'wsadmin.sh', );
has wsadmin_args => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'ArrayRef[Str]',
    default => sub { [] },
);

=head2 servers[]

List of C<WAS::Server> instances configured in this WAS profile. Again, there
is no checking whether they are real or not.

=cut

has servers =>
  ( is => 'ro', isa => 'ArrayRef[WAS::Server]', default => sub { [] }, );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_local()

Tries to determine whether this profile is installed locally or not. This is
done checking the C<host> parameter. Returns true if host is empty or a
local hostname, false otherwise.

=cut

sub is_local {
    my $self = shift;
    return 1 unless $self->has_host;
    return 1 if $self->was_host eq 'localhost';
    return 1 if $self->was_host =~ /^localhost\./;
    eval {
        use Sys::Hostname;
        return 1 if $self->was_host eq hostname;

    };
    eval {
        use Net::Domain qw/hostfqdn/;
        return 1 if $self->was_host eq Net::Domain::hostname();
        return 1 if $self->was_host eq hostfqdn();
    };
    return 0;
}

=head2 wsadmin_path()

Convenience method, returns the full pathname for the C<wsadmin> script.

=cut

sub wsadmin_path {
    my $self = shift;
    return catfile( $self->profile_path, 'bin', $self->wsadmin );
}

=head2 run_script( SCRIPT )

Attemps to spawn C<wsadmin> and run the specified script. The script parameter
must be of the type C<WAS::Script>.

=cut

sub run_script {
    my ( $self, $script ) = ( shift, shift );

    $self->confess('The object passed does not consume the WAS::Script role')
      unless ( blessed($script) && $script->isa('WAS::Script') );
}

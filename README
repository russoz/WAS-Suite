DESCRIPTION
INTERFACE
    prepare_files( EARFILE)
        Given an EARFILE, this method will prepare a wsadmin jython script
        to install it, and copy both the script and the EARFILE to a
        specific directory.

    prepare_remote_install()
        This method will copy the files prepared by the "prepare_files()"
        method to a temporary location in the remote server. This currently
        works only with UNIX systems with SSH daemons.

    do_remote_install()
        Executes the installation script in the remote server.
